# Python-Projects
This is a compilation of the python projects I completed in the third year of my Physics BSc. 

They cover a wide array of subjects, including the visual representations of the differential heat flow eqaution, 
Conway's game of life animations and placing selective cuts on particle physics data using a neural network.
